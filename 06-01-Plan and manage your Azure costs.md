# Plan and manage your Azure costs

## **TCO (Total Cost Ownership) Calculator**

- The TCO Calculator helps you estimate the cost savings of operating your solution on Azure over time compared to operating in your on-premises datacenter.

Working with the TCO Calculator involves three steps:

- Define your workloads: here you define all your on-premise infrastructure: **servers, databases, storage, networking.**
- Adjust assumptions: here you define cost of services such as: software licenses, electricity price, hourly paid for IT administration, network maintenance

## **How do I purchase Azure services?**
